# MNIST Digit Classification with Bernoulli Naive Bayes

The report provides an in-depth analysis of using Bernoulli Naive Bayes to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
It covers the problem description, theory, implementation, and experimental results.

The code for implementing the Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifier can be found in the code directory.
It includes:
  1. naive_bayes.py that implements Bernoulli Naive Bayes Classifier.
  2. MNIST Bernoulli_Naive_Bayes.py that acts as a main and applies the Bernoulli Naive Bayes Classifier to MNIST dataset.
